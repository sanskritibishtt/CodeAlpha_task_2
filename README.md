TASK 1:
KNN Credit Scoring Model Summary
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is used to predict credit scores by analyzing historical financial data. The model works by comparing a customerâ€™s financial behavior with that of similar customers (neighbors) to classify their credit score.

Key steps:

Data Preparation: Financial features like income, debt, and payment history are used as inputs, with categorical variables encoded and numerical variables scaled.

Model Training: The KNN model was trained by finding the optimal number of neighbors (K) using techniques like GridSearchCV.

Evaluation: The model's accuracy was measured, and a confusion matrix was used to assess performance across different credit score categories.

The KNN model provides a straightforward approach to credit scoring, leveraging similarity-based classification to predict customer creditworthiness.


Task 2:
Logistic Regression Heart Disease Prediction Model Summary
The Logistic Regression model is used to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical data.

Key steps:

Data Preparation: Features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators are preprocessed. Categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are scaled.

Model Training: The Logistic Regression model is trained to classify patients into either a heart disease or no heart disease category. Hyperparameters like regularization strength (C) are tuned using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports, allowing for an understanding of how well it predicts heart disease.

The Logistic Regression model provides a clear and interpretable approach for predicting heart disease risk, helping identify individuals at higher risk based on key health metrics.




TASK 3:
 CNN Model for Handwritten Character Recognition
This Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed to recognize handwritten characters using grayscale images. The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, which help in extracting spatial features from the input images. The final layers include dense (fully connected) layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, and it is trained for 20 epochs.

Key steps in the process include:

Data Preprocessing:

Images are resized to 64x64 pixels and normalized to have values between 0 and 1.
Labels are encoded into numerical format and one-hot encoded for multi-class classification.
Model Training:

The model was trained using a split of the dataset into training and testing sets, with validation accuracy tracked throughout the training process.
Model Evaluation:

The model achieved a certain level of accuracy on the test set, which was measured using a confusion matrix and classification report.
Visualizations were generated to understand the model's performance, including plotting accuracy over epochs and displaying a confusion matrix.
Error Analysis:

Misclassified images were plotted to analyze where the model struggled, along with correctly classified examples to understand the model's strengths.
The model was saved in a .keras format for future use, and the trained weights can be loaded back for inference or further fine-tuning. Overall, the model provides a strong baseline for handwritten character recognition tasks, and the visualizations help in understanding its performance and areas for improvement.
