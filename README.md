TASK 2:
KNN Credit Scoring Model Summary
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is used to predict credit scores by analyzing historical financial data. The model works by comparing a customerâ€™s financial behavior with that of similar customers (neighbors) to classify their credit score.

Key steps:

Data Preparation: Financial features like income, debt, and payment history are used as inputs, with categorical variables encoded and numerical variables scaled.

Model Training: The KNN model was trained by finding the optimal number of neighbors (K) using techniques like GridSearchCV.

Evaluation: The model's accuracy was measured, and a confusion matrix was used to assess performance across different credit score categories.

The KNN model provides a straightforward approach to credit scoring, leveraging similarity-based classification to predict customer creditworthiness.
